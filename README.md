## 🧠 About Me

I'm a fourth-year Computer Science & Design student at PES Institute of Technology & Management, Shimoga (VTU), working at the intersection of **generative AI** and **media authenticity verification**. My journey is driven by a fascination with how machines learn to create—and how we can ensure they do so responsibly.

Currently, I'm deep in the trenches of:
- **Large Language Models** – Fine-tuning GPT architectures for specialized domains
- **Deepfake Detection** – Developing CNN-based systems to combat synthetic media manipulation
- **Generative Architectures** – Exploring GANs, VAEs, and Autoencoders for creative AI applications
- **AI Ethics & Safety** – Building systems that are not just powerful, but trustworthy

What sets my approach apart is the blend of **theoretical depth** and **hands-on experimentation**. I don't just implement models—I dissect them, understand their failure modes, and push their boundaries.

### 🎯 Current Focus

```python
current_goals = {
    "learning": ["Transformer architectures", "Diffusion models", "Multimodal AI"],
    "building": ["Production-ready deepfake detection API", "Custom LLM fine-tuning pipelines"],
    "researching": ["Adversarial robustness in generative models", "Synthetic data detection"],
    "contributing": ["Open-source AI tools", "ML education content"]
}

## 🌟 What Drives Me

> "The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' but 'That's funny...'" — Isaac Asimov

I believe the future of AI isn't just about making models bigger—it's about making them **smarter, safer, and more aligned with human values**. My work in deepfake detection stems from this conviction: as AI becomes more powerful at creation, we need equally powerful tools for verification and trust.

I'm particularly energized by:
- **Responsible AI Development** – Building systems that are transparent and explainable
- **Bridging Research & Production** – Taking cutting-edge papers to deployable solutions
- **Knowledge Sharing** – Documenting my learning journey to help others climb faster
- **Collaborative Innovation** – Contributing to open-source AI ecosystems
